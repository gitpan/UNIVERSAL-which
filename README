NAME
    UNIVERSAL::which - tells fully qualified name of the method

SYNOPSIS
      use UNIVERSAL::which;
      use Some::Sub::Class; # which inherits lots of modules
      # ....
      my $o   = Some::Sub::Class->new;
      # in scalar context
      my $fqn = $o->which("method");
      # in list context
      my ($pkg, $name) = $o->which("method");

DESCRIPTION
    UNIVERSAL::which provides only one method, "which".

    As the name suggests, it returns the fully qualified name of a given
    method. Sometimes you want to know the true origin of a method but
    inheritance and AUTOLOAD gets in your way. This module does just that.
